# NOTE
  - Please use a JDK or JRE capable of running Java 17 (Class File Format Version 61).
  - This program uses the Spotify API to play demo tracks from Spotify. Your favorite track might not be available depending on how it is configured on Spotify.
  - Start application by running GuiStart.java.
  - Developed and tested on Windows 10 and 11 using Eclipse IDE.
  - The music player streams songs, so you need **consistent** internet connection to use the music player.
  - The application will be blocked while waiting for the Spotify API to process.
  - There is a 20 tracks limit per playlist due to the fact that there are only 20 buttons variables set up. Since the Library is a playlist, this means that the library might not contain all the songs that another playlist has once the library reaches its limit.
